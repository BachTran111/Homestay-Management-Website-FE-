## 🌏 goTravel – Homestay Booking Management System

### 📖 Introduction
**goTravel** was created with the goal of providing a user-friendly platform for travelers to easily find and book homestays, while also helping homestay owners efficiently manage their business.

Unlike global platforms such as **Agoda** or **Traveloka**, which mainly target large hotel chains worldwide, **goTravel** focuses specifically on the **Da Nang market**.  
This localized approach creates a more personal travel experience and supports small or family-run homestays to grow.

The web application is designed to be **simple yet powerful**, allowing hosts to manage rooms, bookings, and payments online without relying on overly complex systems.
