🌏 goTravel – Homestay Booking Management System
📖 Introduction

goTravel was created with the mission of providing an online platform that allows travelers to easily search and book homestays, while also helping homestay owners manage their businesses more efficiently.

Unlike global platforms such as Agoda or Traveloka—which mainly target large hotel chains—goTravel focuses on the Da Nang market, offering a localized experience tailored to the needs of travelers.

Moreover, goTravel opens opportunities for family-run homestays and small local chains, with a simple web application that enables room management, booking confirmation, and online payments without relying on complex systems.
